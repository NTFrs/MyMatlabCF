This repository contains different matlab scripts and functions written as practice for a course. The objective is to have different pricing methods for Euro, American, and some exotic options (Barriers, Asiatic, Lookback) both in a B&S framework and a Lévy processes (JD and more) framework. Main methods implemented are Montecarlo, FD or FEM, FFT in the case of Euro options with Lévy underlying.
